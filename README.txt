Sabancı academic calendar is not easily syncable to Google Calendar. This tool scrapes the official academic calendar and synchronizes it into Google Calendar via OAuth2.

----------------------------------------
IMPORTANT
----------------------------------------
The "unverified app" screen appears because this is an independent
student-made tool and not a commercial Google-verified app.

This is NORMAL and SAFE.

The app:
- Does NOT access your emails
- Does NOT access your Drive
- Does NOT share your data
- Only accesses your Google Calendar to create events

Each user authenticates separately.
Your Google account is never shared with anyone.

----------------------------------------
IF YOU DON'T SEE EVENTS
----------------------------------------
In Google Calendar:
Enable the calendar:
"Sabanci Academic Calendar by canadaaww"
from the left sidebar.

----------------------------------------
LOG FILE
----------------------------------------
Logs are stored at:
%APPDATA%\SabanciCalendarSync\sync.log

AUTHENTICATION RESET
----------------------------------------
If login fails:
Delete:
%APPDATA%\SabanciCalendarSync\token.json


Then run the EXE again.
